# selenium-pytest-automation

This repository contains an automated Selenium Pytest framework that interacts with the elements and sections of the automation practice site, https://demoqa.com/. The focus has not been the design of coherent test cases since the intention in creating this framework has been to demonstrate the ability to interact in multiple ways with a wide variety of elements, which can of course be eventually focused on automated testing.
